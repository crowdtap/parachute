# TODO

## Priority

* Move from complicated integration tests to using rewire and sinon only.

## Backlog

* Refactor Dependency#copy method, too much nesting going on.
* Check if Dependency.src is local repo and exists, and don't cache again.
* Switch to promises using q.
* Better tests for error emit events?
